## Overview
Know Your Age is a Website where users can enter their Date of Birth and the website will give their current age.

How does it work?
firstly, When the users enter their date of birth.
and then the website performs simple mathematics and subtracts the given date of birth from the current date.
and finally, the output is shown on the screen.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
